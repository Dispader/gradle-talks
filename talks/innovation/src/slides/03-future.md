# Looking forward

Some things in the pipelineâ€¦

## Dependency management

We are continuing to add new dependency management features, primarily for conflict control and precision.

Also working on a new model to cover:

* Variants
* Publication types (beyond single file)
* Context sensitive dependency consumption

## Implicit plugins

Being able to have plugins applied automatically. 

For example, based on the name of a requested task.

That is, no need to add `wrapper` or `compareGradleBuilds` tasks.

## JavaScript

Improving the documentation for the existing JavaScript support in Gradle.

* Minification/Compression
* Static Analysis (e.g. JSHint)
* Transpiling (e.g. CoffeeScript)
* Test Execution (e.g. Jasmine)

All based on a general purpose JavaScript tool toolkit (based on Rhino).

## C/C++

Continuing to improve the support for building C and C++ projects with Gradle.


## Plugin Developers

## Enterprise scalability
