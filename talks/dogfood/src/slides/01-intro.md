## This Talk

Inside look at how the Gradle project runs.

* How we do software
* Practical application of best practices
* Personal experiences & anecdotes
* Not a prescription

## The Gradle “project”

Where project = build.

* ~ 6 very distributed full time engineers
* Frequent, regular releases (~ 6 weeks)
* ~17k LOC (mostly Java, some Groovy)
* ~2k test classes
* 37 modules
* Documentation / Release notes

## The Gradle “project”

Where project = the larger project.

* User support
* Communication / marketing
* Collaboration (e.g. pull requests)
* Web presence
* Delivery
* Usage analytics

## The Requirements

* Reliability (high quality level)
* Backwards compatibility (assured)
* Steady, predictable, pace
* Transparency
* Adoption growth (awareness)
* Efficacy (productivity)

## Automation

Critical for high performing small teams.

* Cheapest way to achieve high quality
* Continuous investment
* Persistent problem
* Everyone's responsibility

Automate _everything_, not just the build/delivery.
