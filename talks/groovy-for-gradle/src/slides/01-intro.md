# Groovy For Gradle Users

The language that powers Gradle builds.

## Why Study Groovy?

* Little or no Groovy skills:
    * Use Gradle
    * Tweak existing build scripts
    * Author trivial Gradle builds
    
* Working knowledge of Groovy:
    * Author non-trivial Gradle builds
    * Develop custom tasks and plugins (in Groovy)
    * Truly understand Gradle
    * Push automation to the next level
    * Use Groovy in other areas (testing, embedded DSLs, etc.)
    
## Groovy

* Dynamic scripting language for the JVM
* Tightly integrated with the Java platform
* Inspired by Java, Ruby, Python, etc.
* Compiles to byte code
* Close to Java in terms of syntax, semantics, and APIs
* Easy to learn for Java developers (by design)

## Groovy Console

* A GUI REPL (read-execute-print-loop) program
* Great for experimenting with Groovy
* When using Gradle, great for isolating Groovy

Once Groovy is installed, can be run via running `groovyConsole`.
