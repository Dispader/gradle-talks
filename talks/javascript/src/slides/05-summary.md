# Wrapping upâ€¦

## DIY 

Gradles core tools/utilities make it easy to build your own support for JS tools.

* FileTree / FileCollection
* Exec
* JavaExec
* Ant integration

## New Core Support

* Deep Rhino integration
* Browser/Scriptable DOM runtime abstractions
* 100% portable headless EnvJs browser

Right now, focus on supporting infrastructure to enable JavaScript based tooling. Also, to allow different JS plugins to compose together well.

Over time, will expand to encompass Dependency Management and project conventions.

## Summary

Not a lot of out of the box magic for JavaScript right now.

Gradle's flexibility makes it a capable environment for building your own JS automation.

JavaScript is an important future platform for Gradle.
